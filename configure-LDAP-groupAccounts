lxc import <ldap file>
lxc start <ldap server name>

install
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libnss-ldapd

nss --> "name service switch"
A convenient way for linux to get data about the various things from various sources
So when a linux needs to get information on things like user accounts, groups, passwords, hostnames
etc... it could consult the NSS to find out where to get this data from.

During the install, a box will show up saying "Configuring nslcd"
nslcd --> name service local daemon
This is a component responsible for retrieving data from the LDAP server.
So this is why I need to type in the ipaddress of the LDAP server, telling nslcd where to get the
data from.


To see all users, both defined locally and in the LDAP server, you can use this command:

getent passwd

getent --> short for "get entry"

If you want to filter out only entries from the ldap server, Uset these flags with getent

getent passwd --service ldap

For group entries:

getent group --service ldap

Because there could be issues with users and their home directories, run the following:

sudo pam-auth-update

and you will be presented with a menu. Make sure to select the box that says
"create home directory on login".
