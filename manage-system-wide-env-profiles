You can see the current users environment using the following command:

printenv or env

If a user wants to edit or add their own environment variable. they can edit the .basrc file.
Setting a variable for every user on the system:
edit the /etc/environment file. --> this is for setting an environment variable. there are more complex things we can do like having a command run every time a user logs in.

We can use the /etc/profile.d directory to achieve this
We can add a shell script here. The shell scripts that are written here don't need the shebang ("#!/bin/bash")


Manage Template User Environment

When new user accounts are created, There is one action that happens by default. All filesfrom the /etc/skel directory are copied to the new users home directory. this can be helpful when needing to create a template for the new user's environment.


Scenario: I have a default policy that all new users need to have. what I'll do is create a README file in the etc/skel directory so when a new user is created, it will be in their home environment.
Next = Add a user named trinity and then login with her account.
sudo adduser trinity
su trinity
ls -a /home/trinity
