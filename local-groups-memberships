Practical example. Add a user named john and then create a groups called "developers" and then add john to that group.

sudo add user john
sudo groupadd developers

sudo gpasswd --add john developers OR sudo gpasswd -a john developers
to verify:
groups john

** in the STDOUT of the groups <user> command, the name after the colon is the "primary" or the "login" group. The rest are secondary or supplementary groups **

To remove a user from a group:
sudo gpasswd --delete john developers OR sudo gpasswd -d john developers

Change the primary group of a user ** -g and -G are different **
sudo usermod -g developers john or sudo usermod --gid developers john
the -G flag targets the secondary group for a user.

rename a group:
sudo groupmod --new-name programmers developers OR sudo groupmod -n programmers developers



** When a new group is added to the system, the current login session will not see it until you either sign out and sign in or reboot the machine. **



delete a group
sudo groupdel programmers
You cant delete this group if this group is a primary one for another user.
