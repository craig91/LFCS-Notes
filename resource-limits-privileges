To set user resource limits, we can edit the following file:
/etc/secuity/limits.conf

<domain>
The domain can have usernames, groups (to set a limit for everyone in a group, put an "@" infront of the group name.
for example:
    <domain>
    trinity
    @developers --> sets limit for everyone in this group.
    * --> sets limit for all user on the system. This will apply to every user NOT shown in this file (limits.conf) A user specific limit overrides the global * limit.

<type>
This field can take 3 different values: soft, hard,"-"
hard limit --> cannot be overwriten by a regular user.
soft limit --> describes the initial value for the limit when the user logs in the system.
               If this user needs temporary need to increase this limit, they can do so.
- --> This dash implements a hard and a soft limit. So if I have a user with a - 20, this means this user 
      can use up to or all of the 20 processes without having to manually increase it.

<item>
This limit determines what the limit is actually for. For example:
"nproc" --> this sets a maximum number of processes that can be open in a user's session.
"fsize" --> sets the maximum file size that can be created in a user's session. Sizes are written in KB.
"cpu" --> sets a limit for the cpu time in minutes. The seconds being used matters here. So not 1 minute of human time, but 1 minute of cpu time (at 100% usage)

<value>


To see the limit(s) for my current session:

ulimit -a

To see or DECREASE the limit of processes:

ulimit -u <number of processes you want to decrease to>

ex: ulimit -u 5000 --> decreases the process limit to 5000

By default, a user can only lower their limits not increase them. The only exception is 
when you wanna raise TO the hard limit or anything less than the hard limit (soft limit)
It cannot be raised a 2nd time once you do this.


Manage User Privileges

Whoever is a part of the sudo group, is allowed to use sudo.
A simple way of adding a user to the sudo group:

sudo gpasswd -a trinity sudo

A file for more fine tuned sudo control.
sudoers file: /etc/sudoers

This file defines who can use sudo and under what conditions, what commands they can run
and so on.
You should not edit this file directly. You can use visudo to make changes.
This utility checks if the edits are correct to help avoid making mistkes in this file.

visudo breakdown

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

%sudo --> user group. here we define who this policy is for.

ALL (1) --> The Host. Here I can specify that these rules apply if our server's hostname 
or IP address has a specific value.

ALL (2) --> run-as-user field. Here, we can type in a list of usernames. 
ALL (3) --> run-as-group field.

ALL (4) --> List of commands that can be run with sudo
