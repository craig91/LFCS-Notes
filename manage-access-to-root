To login as root:

sudo --login OR sudo -i

logout --> logs out of root

If the user does not have sudo privileges but knows the root password:

su - OR su -l OR su --login --> using this method, you have to type in the root password and not your password like the command above

When root is locked you can still use:
sudo --login
This is because the password for the current user is not locked
But you cannot use:
sudo -
because that will ask for the root password

If you want users to login with a password, you have 2 options:
1st step is to verify if the root password is set. If it isn't you can do the following:

sudo passwd root

If a password was set in the past but it was locked for some reason you can use the following command:

sudo passwd --unlock root OR sudo passwd -u root

After these steps have been taken you can use the:
 
su - 

command and type in the root password.

You can lock password based login to the root account by performing the following command:

sudo passwd --lock root OR sudo passwd -l root
